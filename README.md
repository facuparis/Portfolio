# [Impact of prisons on their surrounding venues](https://github.com/facuparis/Coursera_Capstone)
The main goal of this proyect is to describe one of the socioeconomic impacts of prisons: the number of venues in their surroundings. The focus will be to find and describe the influence radius of the prisons in the state of Alabama. Finally, we want to cluster the prisons by the similarities on their influences.  
This report is directed towards governments who want to  better understand the behaviour of society, and also towards helping investors make more informed decisions on whether to start a venue or not near a facility.  This is the capstone project in the IBM Data Science Course , hosted by Coursera.
